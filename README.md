# Translate zip codes into FIPS codes

This is an attempt to convert zip codes into FIPS codes. The final result is in the file `zip2fips.csv`. This is a work in progress, not all zip codes are correctly mapped yet.

This work heavily relies on the **zipcoder** R package, which contains extensive info about US zip codes.
